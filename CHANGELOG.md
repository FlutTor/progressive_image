# [v1.0.0](https://pub.dev/packages/progressive_image/versions/1.0.0)

- Created flutter widget which progressively loads larger images using Low Quality Image Placeholders.
- Displays Placeholder and Thumbnail image until the Original image loads.
- Smooth Fade-in animations for preventing immediate image popups on load.
- Blur effect for low resolution thumbnails to prevent the pixelated view.
- Effectively resolves Thumbnail images before the Original image starts to fetch for quick first impression.
